This repository contains a framework to: 
- assess the predictability of a timeseries
- investigate the impact of inaccurate weather forecasts on that predictability
The framework is applied to a 1-year case study where a Distribution Grid Operator performed congestion management to balance the electricity grid.

The manuscript of that analysis is under preparation.
This work is part of the [Every Ray Counts!](https://www.nwo.nl/projecten/nwaid17051-0) research project.
